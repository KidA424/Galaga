# Galaga

This homemade version of Galaga was my final project for a CS class I took in 2012.  I created and implemented the physics engine myself using timer events and linear algebra.  The artwork was taken from google searches and edited in GIMP.  Music by Nosaj Thing.

Note: The game is barely stable.  I think it contains a lot of experimental features that I never completed or removed, so don't expect much.  I worked very hard on it for a few weeks, then never touched it again.

Build:
```shell
javac assignment5/Main.java
```

Run:
```shell
java assignment5/Main
```
    File > Play Galaga
